These are used for sequential transversal and repetition.
For i in sequence:                  1:for iterator -var in sequence:
      statement 1                             stsatement()
      statement 2


      Example:

1) For i in range(5):      O/P:01234
         Print(i)

2) x=(10,20,30,40)
   for i in x:
      print(i)
